# RAVE YOGA - Shopify Dawn Theme Customizations

**Theme Version:** Dawn 15.3.0
**Project:** Migrate rave-yoga.com to Shopify using Dawn theme.
**Date Started:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Overview

This document tracks all customizations made to the base Dawn theme for the Rave Yoga Shopify store. The goal is to replicate the design and functionality of the existing `rave-yoga.com` website while adhering to Shopify best practices, maintaining theme upgradeability where possible, and ensuring a performant storefront.

## General Customization Strategy

- **CSS Variables:** Custom CSS variables are defined in `snippets/rave-variables.liquid` and are prefixed with `--rave-`. These variables leverage theme settings for brand colors defined in `config/settings_schema.json` under "Rave Brand Settings".
- **Custom CSS:** All custom CSS rules are placed in `assets/rave-custom.css` and BEM-style classes are prefixed with `rave-` (e.g., `rave-hero__title`).
- **Custom JavaScript:** Custom JavaScript is contained within `assets/rave-custom.js`, using an IIFE to avoid global scope pollution. Event listeners and Shopify section events are used where appropriate.
- **Liquid Modifications:** Changes to existing Dawn Liquid files are clearly marked with `<!-- RAVE CUSTOMIZATION START -->` and `<!-- RAVE CUSTOMIZATION END -->` comments. New sections and snippets are created with a `rave-` prefix or a clear custom naming convention.
- **Localization:** All new user-facing strings are added to `locales/rave-yoga.en.default.json` and referenced in Liquid using the `t:` filter (e.g., `{{ 'sections.custom_hero.title' | t }}`).
- **Asset Organization:** Custom images and assets are named with a `rave-` prefix and stored in the `assets` directory (e.g., `assets/rave-logo.png`).

## Known Update Risks & Considerations

*(This section will highlight any customizations that might conflict with future Dawn theme updates or require manual review after updates.)*

- Overrides to core Dawn CSS variables in `rave-variables.liquid` should be checked against new Dawn versions.
- Modifications to `theme.liquid` for including custom assets are generally safe but should be verified.

- LCP, CLS, FID to be monitored for each new major component.
