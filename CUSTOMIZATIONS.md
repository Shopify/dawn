## Overview

This document tracks all customizations made to the base Dawn theme for the Rave Yoga Shopify store. The goal is to replicate the design and functionality of the existing `rave-yoga.com` website while adhering to Shopify best practices, maintaining theme upgradeability where possible, and ensuring a performant storefront.

## General Customization Strategy

- **CSS Variables:** Custom CSS variables are defined in `snippets/rave-variables.liquid` and are prefixed with `--rave-`. These variables leverage theme settings for brand colors defined in `config/settings_schema.json` under "Rave Brand Settings".
- **Custom CSS:** All custom CSS rules are placed in `assets/rave-custom.css` and BEM-style classes are prefixed with `rave-` (e.g., `rave-hero__title`).
- **Custom JavaScript:** Custom JavaScript is contained within `assets/rave-custom.js`, using an IIFE to avoid global scope pollution. Event listeners and Shopify section events are used where appropriate.
- **Liquid Modifications:** Changes to existing Dawn Liquid files are clearly marked with `<!-- RAVE CUSTOMIZATION START -->` and `<!-- RAVE CUSTOMIZATION END -->` comments. New sections and snippets are created with a `rave-` prefix or a clear custom naming convention.
- **Localization:** All new user-facing strings are added to `locales/rave-yoga.en.default.json` and referenced in Liquid using the `t:` filter (e.g., `{{ 'sections.custom_hero.title' | t }}`).
- **Asset Organization:** Custom images and assets are named with a `rave-` prefix and stored in the `assets` directory (e.g., `assets/rave-logo.png`).

### Home Page

- **Hero Banner:** (Details to be added)

### Collection Page

- (Details to be added)
- **Badge Styling (2023-09-07)**: Updated "Sold Out" and "On Sale" badges to display as rectangular banners in Rave brown color (#3D2120) with white text. Positioned at the top-left of product images. Implementation in `assets/rave-custom.css`.

### Product Page

#### Complementary Products Feature (2024-12-20)

**Implementation Summary:**
- Added complementary products as a third collapsible section on product detail pages
- Positioned after "Product Information" and "Shipping & Returns" sections
- Integrated seamlessly with existing accordion styling and behavior

**Key Files Modified:**
- `templates/product.json`: Added complementary products block with quick-add enabled
- `sections/main-product.liquid`: Enhanced with promotional message settings (lines 1426-1445)
- `assets/rave-custom.css`: Extensive styling for perfect visual integration

**Shopify Customizer Settings Added:**
- `block_heading`: Customizable section title (default: "Complementary Products")
- `show_promotional_message`: Toggle for promotional message display
- `promotional_message`: Custom promotional text field
- `enable_quick_add`: Direct add-to-cart functionality
- `product_list_limit`: Number of products to display (default: 6)
- `products_per_page`: Products per pagination page (default: 3)
- `image_ratio`: Product image aspect ratio (default: square)

**Design Integration Challenges & Solutions:**

1. **Border Conflicts (Major Issue)**
   - **Problem**: Dawn's component-complementary-products.css added extra top borders
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive CSS overrides targeting multiple selector combinations:
     - `.product .complementary-products` and all variations
     - `aside.product__accordion.accordion` specific targeting
     - `product-recommendations` container styling
   - **Final Fix**: Used `:not(:last-child)` and `:last-of-type` selectors to preserve bottom border only on last accordion item

2. **Icon Removal**
   - **Problem**: Dawn's default accordion icons conflicted with custom +/- design
   - **Solution**: Aggressive icon hiding using multiple properties:
     ```css
     display: none !important;
     visibility: hidden !important;
     opacity: 0 !important;
     ```

3. **Typography Consistency**
   - **Challenge**: Ensure identical styling across mobile and desktop
   - **Solution**: Moved collapsible tab styling outside desktop media query
   - **Key Properties**: Inter font, 9px size, uppercase transform, normal weight
   - **Mobile Variables**: Added CSS custom properties for responsive padding

4. **Product Card Alignment**
   - **Initial Issue**: Product cards flush left, misaligned with promotional text
   - **Iterations**: 
     - First attempt: `var(--product-info-padding-left, 1rem)` - too far right
     - Final solution: `0.5rem` padding for perfect alignment

**CSS Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Variable Strategy**: Used CSS custom properties for responsive padding:
   ```css
   --product-info-padding-left: 1rem; /* mobile */
   --product-info-padding-left: 15px; /* desktop */
   ```

2. **Selector Specificity**: Employed high-specificity selectors to override Dawn defaults:
   ```css
   .product .complementary-products.is-accordion.quick-add-hidden
   ```

3. **Cross-Device Consistency**: Applied core styling globally, then added device-specific overrides

**Testing & Troubleshooting:**

1. **Development Server Sync Issues**
   - **Problem**: Changes visible in preview but not localhost
   - **Solution**: Restarted development server and cleared browser cache
   - **Root Cause**: Template changes required server restart to sync

2. **Border Persistence**
   - **Issue**: Extra border remained despite multiple CSS attempts
   - **Investigation**: Used browser dev tools to identify exact element hierarchy
   - **Resolution**: Required targeting `aside` element specifically, not just container classes

3. **Icon Layout Disruption**
   - **Problem**: Dawn's accordion icons appeared despite +/- custom implementation
   - **Fix**: Comprehensive icon selector targeting including nested elements

**Performance Considerations:**
- Leveraged existing Dawn complementary products functionality (no custom JS required)
- CSS additions: ~100 lines focused on integration styling
- Quick-add functionality uses Dawn's built-in components
- No additional HTTP requests for core functionality

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Border styling may need review if Dawn updates component-complementary-products.css
- CSS variable approach allows easy adjustment of spacing/alignment
- Icon hiding selectors should be checked against Dawn icon structure changes
- Promotional message styling is self-contained and theme-update safe

### Cart & E-commerce

- **Cart Drawer:** (2024-12-21)
  - **Purpose:** Replaced notification-style cart with side-sliding cart drawer for better user experience
  - **Files Modified:**
    - `sections/header.liquid`: Uncommented cart icon to enable clickable cart functionality, added floating cart icon
    - `config/settings_schema.json`: Changed default cart type from 'notification' to 'drawer'
    - `assets/rave-custom.css`: Added comprehensive RAVE brand styling for all cart drawer components and floating cart icon
  - **Features:**
    - **Floating Cart Icon**: Fixed position on right side of screen, vertically centered, flush against right edge
    - **Brown Square Design**: 5rem x 5rem brown square with white cart icon (RAVE accent color #412F26)
    - **Hover Effects**: Transitions to darker brown (#3D2120) with subtle scale animation (1.05x)
    - **Cart Count Bubble**: Circular badge positioned at top-right corner when items are in cart
    - Side-sliding drawer panel with cart contents
    - Quantity controls with + / - buttons
    - Remove item functionality
    - Checkout button with RAVE brand colors
    - Empty cart state with "Continue Shopping" button
    - **Responsive Design**: Scales appropriately for mobile (4.5rem) and desktop (5rem)
    - **Hidden Header Icon**: Original header cart icon is completely hidden to avoid duplication
  - **Technical Implementation:**
    - **Positioning**: `position: fixed; top: 50%; right: 0; transform: translateY(-50%)`
    - **Z-Index**: 1000 to ensure it appears above all other content
    - **Accessibility**: Maintains Dawn's built-in ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
    - **Performance**: Uses CSS transforms and transitions for smooth animations
  - **Styling:** All cart components use RAVE CSS variables for consistent brand colors and typography
  
  - **Cart Drawer Layout Optimization (2024-12-21):**
    - **Issue Identified**: Cart drawer displayed duplicate pricing information and unnecessary table headers
    - **Problems Solved:**
      1. **Duplicate Pricing**: Each product showed price twice - once in product details and once in "Total" column
      2. **Orphaned Headers**: "Product" and "Total" column headers looked cluttered and unnecessary
      3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Table structure was overly complex for cart display
    - **CSS Solutions Implemented:**
      ```css
      /* Hide entire table header row */
      .cart-drawer table.cart-items thead { display: none !important; }
      
      /* Hide all column headers individually (fallback) */
      #CartDrawer-ColumnTotal,
      #CartDrawer-ColumnProduct,
      #CartDrawer-ColumnProductImage { display: none !important; }
      
      /* Hide duplicate totals cell for each cart item */
      .cart-drawer .cart-item__totals { display: none !important; }
      
      /* Adjust grid layout for remaining columns */
      .cart-drawer .cart-item { grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr auto !important; }
      ```
    - **Final Layout**: Clean, streamlined cart with only essential information:
      - Product image
      - Product details (name, price, variants) 
      - Quantity controls
    - **User Experience**: Eliminates visual confusion while maintaining all functionality
    - **Maintenance**: Organized CSS rules for easy future modifications
  
  - **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Successfully merged to main branch with layout optimizations (2024-12-21)

## Known Update Risks & Considerations

*(This section will highlight any customizations that might conflict with future Dawn theme updates or require manual review after updates.)*

- Overrides to core Dawn CSS variables in `rave-variables.liquid` should be checked against new Dawn versions.
- Modifications to `theme.liquid` for including custom assets are generally safe but should be verified.
- **Complementary Products Styling (High Risk)**: Extensive CSS overrides for Dawn's component-complementary-products.css may conflict with future updates. Key areas to review:
  - Border styling and accordion integration
  - Icon hiding selectors if Dawn changes icon implementation
  - Promotional message positioning if Dawn modifies block structure

## Performance Monitoring Notes

*(Notes on performance impact and optimizations for custom sections/features will be added here.)*

- LCP, CLS, FID to be monitored for each new major component.
- **Complementary Products**: No performance impact expected - leverages existing Dawn functionality with styling-only modifications

## QA Checklist Reminders

- Pixel diff â‰¤2 px on 1440w viewport (target).
- 90+ mobile Lighthouse score, <2s LCP (target).
- Test on defined breakpoints: mobile, 750px (tablet), 990px (desktop).
- Verify all custom text uses translation keys.
- Check for console errors in JS.
- Validate HTML structure.
- **Product Page Specific**: Test complementary products display, quick-add functionality, and accordion behavior across all devices 

## Configuration Changes

- **`config/settings_schema.json`**: 
    - Added "Rave Brand Settings" for theme editor color controls.
    - Changed default cart type from 'notification' to 'drawer' to enable cart drawer (2024-12-21).
