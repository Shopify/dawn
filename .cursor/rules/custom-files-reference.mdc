# Custom Files Reference

This document outlines the key custom files created or significantly modified for the Rave Yoga Shopify theme migration.

*   **`[assets/rave-custom.css](mdc:assets/rave-custom.css)`**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains all primary custom CSS overrides and new styles for the theme.
    *   **Structure:** Organized with comments for global resets (use sparingly), Rave-specific utility classes, and section-specific styles (e.g., `/* == HEADER == */`, `/* == FOOTER == */`).
    *   **Important:** This file is enqueued in `[layout/theme.liquid](mdc:layout/theme.liquid)`.

*   **`[assets/rave-custom.js](mdc:assets/rave-custom.js)`**
    *   **Purpose:** Houses custom JavaScript functionalities.
    *   **Structure:** Currently uses an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to avoid polluting the global scope.
    *   **Important:** This file is enqueued in `[layout/theme.liquid](mdc:layout/theme.liquid)`.

*   **`[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)`**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines custom CSS variables for Rave Yoga brand (colors, fonts). It also maps these custom variables to Dawn's global CSS variables where appropriate.
    *   **Source of Values:** Uses color settings defined in Theme Settings -> "Rave Brand Settings" (from `[config/settings_schema.json](mdc:config/settings_schema.json)`).
    *   **Important:** Included in `[layout/theme.liquid](mdc:layout/theme.liquid)` *before* `rave-custom.css` is loaded to ensure variables are available.

*   **`[config/settings_schema.json](mdc:config/settings_schema.json)`**
    *   **Purpose:** Modified to add a new "Rave Brand Settings" section in the Shopify Theme Customizer.
    *   **Functionality:** Allows easy selection of brand colors (primary text, secondary text, accent, main background) via color pickers. These settings are then used by `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)`.

*   **`[locales/en.default.json](mdc:locales/en.default.json)`**
    *   **Purpose:** The default English localization file for the theme. Used for any custom text strings required by the theme that are not part of standard Shopify/Dawn translations.

*   **`[layout/theme.liquid](mdc:layout/theme.liquid)`**
    *   **Purpose:** The main theme layout file. Modified to correctly include/enqueue custom assets:
        1.  `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)` (as a snippet render).
        2.  `[assets/rave-custom.css](mdc:assets/rave-custom.css)` (as a stylesheet link).
        3.  `[assets/rave-custom.js](mdc:assets/rave-custom.js)` (as a script tag, typically deferred).

*   **`[sections/header.liquid](mdc:sections/header.liquid)`**
    *   **Purpose:** The Liquid file for the header section. Has been significantly modified from the default Dawn header.
    *   **Key Customizations:** Contains Liquid logic to split the main navigation menu for desktop view (when logo is centered) and to hide default header icons. Also structured to support distinct mobile layout requirements.

*   **`[CUSTOMIZATIONS.md](mdc:CUSTOMIZATIONS.md)`**
    *   **Purpose:** A manually maintained Markdown file intended to log significant customizations, decisions, and troubleshooting steps made during the project. This helps with future maintenance and understanding the evolution of the theme.
