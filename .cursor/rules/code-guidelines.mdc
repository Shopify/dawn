Rave Theme Code Guidelines

This rule outlines the coding standards and best practices for the Rave Yoga Shopify theme project, ensuring consistent, maintainable, and robust code.

**CSS Variables and Theme Integration**
* Use CSS variables defined in snippets/rave-variables.liquid instead of hardcoded values
* Connect styling to Shopify Customizer settings in config/settings_schema.json

**File Organization**
* Add custom CSS to assets/rave-custom.css with clear section markers
* Place custom JavaScript in assets/rave-custom.js
* Document significant changes in CUSTOMIZATIONS.md

**Responsive Design Standards**
* Follow mobile-first approach
* Use Dawn's standard breakpoints:

**Class Naming and Structure**
* Follow BEM methodology for custom classes
* Use semantic, descriptive names that reveal purpose
* Maintain consistency with Dawn's naming conventions when extending functionality

**CSS Specificity Management**
* Use appropriate specificity to override Dawn's base styles
* Limit use of !important to targeted overrides only when necessary
* Structure selectors from least to most specific

**Theme Update Safety**
* Isolate custom code from core theme files when possible
* When modifying core files, use HTML comments to mark changes
* Avoid direct edits to core assets like base.css

**Custom Block Development**
* Use underscores in block type names in schema
* Use hyphens in CSS class names:
* Ensure block IDs in templates exactly match schema types

**Testing and Debugging**
* Test across devices and browsers after each significant change
* Use browser developer tools to inspect style inheritance and overrides
* Verify mobile menu and responsive layouts function correctly
* Check Shopify Customizer settings impact on styled elements

**Git Workflow**
* Follow established branch naming:
* Features: feat/descriptive-name
* Bug fixes: fix/descriptive-name
* Make atomic commits focused on single logical changes
