# Project Overview

**Goal:** Migrate the Readymag site `rave-yoga.com` to Shopify using the Dawn theme (v15.3.0), aiming for a pixel-perfect replication of the design. The initial focus has been on replicating the header.

**Key Technologies:**
*   Shopify Liquid for templating and logic.
*   CSS (within the context of Dawn's SCSS structure, but primarily custom CSS additions).
*   Custom JavaScript for any behaviors not covered by theme settings or Liquid.
*   Shopify Theme Customizer for settings and content.

**Primary Custom Files & Starting Points:**
*   Main custom styles: `[assets/rave-custom.css](mdc:assets/rave-custom.css)`
*   Custom JavaScript: `[assets/rave-custom.js](mdc:assets/rave-custom.js)`
*   Custom CSS Variables: `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)`
*   Theme settings additions: `[config/settings_schema.json](mdc:config/settings_schema.json)`
*   Main layout file: `[layout/theme.liquid](mdc:layout/theme.liquid)` (for including custom assets)
*   Header section: `[sections/header.liquid](mdc:sections/header.liquid)` (heavily customized)

**Development Approach:**
*   Follow the "Super-Prompt 3" workflow (Technical PM/Lead Dev, sprint-based).
*   Utilize Shopify CLI for local development (e.g., `shopify theme dev --store YOUR_STORE.myshopify.com`).
*   Maintain a `[CUSTOMIZATIONS.md](mdc:CUSTOMIZATIONS.md)` file for logging significant changes.
*   Prioritize theme update safety by isolating custom CSS/JS, using CSS variables, and commenting Liquid changes.
