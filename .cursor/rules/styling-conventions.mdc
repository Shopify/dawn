# Styling Conventions and Brand Assets

This rule outlines the primary styling conventions, brand assets (colors, fonts), and CSS structure used in the Rave Yoga Shopify theme customization.

## CSS Variables and Custom Properties

*   **Central Definition:** Custom CSS variables for the Rave Yoga brand are centrally defined in `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)`.
*   **Source of Values:** These variables often pull their values from theme settings configured in the Shopify Customizer, specifically under "Rave Brand Settings" (added via `[config/settings_schema.json](mdc:config/settings_schema.json)`).
*   **Mapping to Dawn:** `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)` also maps these custom Rave brand variables to Dawn's standard global CSS variables (e.g., `--color-text`, `--color-background`, `--color-button`) to ensure brand consistency throughout the theme.
*   **Usage:** All custom CSS written in `[assets/rave-custom.css](mdc:assets/rave-custom.css)` should prioritize using these defined CSS variables (e.g., `var(--rave-color-primary-text)`) rather than hardcoding hex values.

## Brand Colors

These are the primary brand colors, accessible via their respective CSS variables defined in `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)`:

*   **Primary Text:** `#3D2120` (variable: `--rave-color-primary-text`)
*   **Main Background:** `#FFFFFF` (variable: `--rave-color-background-main`)
*   **Secondary Text:** `#555555` (variable: `--rave-color-secondary-text`)
*   **Accent Color:** `#412F26` (variable: `--rave-color-accent`)
*   **Button Text:** `#FFFFFF` (variable: `--rave-color-button-text` - typically used with the accent color as button background)

## Typography

*   **Primary Font Stack:** "Inter" (including its fallbacks like `sans-serif`).
*   **Theme Setting:** The "Inter" font is set globally via the Shopify Theme Customizer (Theme Settings -> Typography).
*   **CSS Variables:** `[snippets/rave-variables.liquid](mdc:snippets/rave-variables.liquid)` captures the theme's font choices into variables like `--rave-font-stack-primary` and `--rave-font-stack-secondary`, which are then mapped to Dawn's `--font-heading-family` and `--font-body-family`.

## Breakpoints and Responsive Design

*   **Approach:** Mobile-first.
*   **Key Breakpoints Used in Custom CSS:**
    *   **Mobile:** Styles typically apply by default, or are scoped within `@media screen and (max-width: 749px) { ... }`.
    *   **Tablet (Implied):** Styles for viewports between `750px` and `989px` are handled by styles that apply from `min-width: 750px` but are overridden by `min-width: 990px` desktop styles if necessary.
    *   **Desktop:** Styles are typically scoped within `@media screen and (min-width: 990px) { ... }`. This is Dawn's primary desktop breakpoint.

## CSS File Structure (`[assets/rave-custom.css](mdc:assets/rave-custom.css)`)

*   The file is intended to be organized with clear comments:
    1.  Global Resets or Overrides (use sparingly).
    2.  Rave Specific Reusable Utility Classes.
    3.  Component/Section Specific Styles (e.g., `/* == HEADER == */`, `/* == FOOTER == */`, `/* == MOBILE MENU == */`).
