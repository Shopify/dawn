In the same year, 51% of all work-related ill health and 55% of all sick days were due to work stress, depression or anxiety.<\/p><p>Clearly, stress at work is a global problem. But other than wanting your employees to live happier, less stressful lives, what does it have to do with you as a business owner?<\/p><p>With employees taking so much time off due to workplace stress, it could be directly impacting your business’ bottom line. <\/p><p>When your employees are stressed, it’s likely that they’re not as focused at work as they should be. In fact, research has shown that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stress.org\/workplace-stress\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">50% of employees<\/span><\/a> aren’t engaged at work due to stress, resulting in reduced productivity. Businesses then have to recoup the costs associated with sick days and a lack of productivity at work, meaning that businesses spend 75% of a worker’s annual salary to cover the cost of lost productivity and employee absences.<\/p><p>Investing in workplace stress management, then, can help to reduce the number of sick days your staff are taking, as well as helping to ensure that employees are more engaged and present when they are working. But, according to in-depth research by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cipd.co.uk\/Export\/ToPdf?path=%252fknowledge%252fculture%252fwell-being%252fstress-factsheet\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development<\/span><\/a> (CIPD), of organizations that are taking steps to tackle stress at work, just 52% think that they’re effective in doing so. That means there’s a lot still to be done when it comes to managing stress in the workplace.<\/p>",

A major one is the relationship between employees and their managers, with the Zippia research showing that 80% of workers say that a change in leadership affects their stress levels. If you bring in a new management team, or pass employees from manager to manager, it’s important to be aware of how that could affect the worker.<\/p><p>Ineffective communication at work is another contributing factor to overall stress levels, with a whopping 80% of US employees stating they’re stressed due to poor communication in their workplace. <\/p><p>The working environment can also play a huge part in stress levels. From poor relationships with colleagues to being unable to concentrate because of a noisy workplace, there are multiple factors that could be contributing to how stressed an employee feels.
