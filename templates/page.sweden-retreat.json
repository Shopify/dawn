Workshops and time spent in nature.<br/><br/>This October, we are retreating into the magical oasis that is our retreat location in Sweden. A magical house embedded in sprawling land on the Swedish countryside, only 45mins from Copenhagen. We will take a prolonged weekend to gather, celebrate the change of the seasons, and cultivate the light within us.<br/><br/>The house invites you to fully let go of the past and future — just embrace the energy of the land and the present moment. You will explore all the hidden corners of the house, practice yoga in the old ballroom, light a fire in the tipi by the private lake and sleep a deep, restful sleep. This experience is for all those who wish to rejuvenate, re-connect and fill their own cup as we transition to the colder months.<br/>You will have lots of space to sprawl out across the house, no matter the weather, or jump into our outdoor sauna.<br/><br/>We will start our mornings with prolonged yoga session - always with a different theme to tune into the day. You will receive a clear immersion into yoga postures, breathwork and meditation that is suited to your unique body and level of experience.<br/>The day will flow further with a beautiful sprawling brunch prepared indoors our outdoors by our wonderful chef Trine. You will have time to wander the forest, journal in your new magic of I journals and relax deeply. The afternoons are filled with workshops, yoga and lots of aromatherapy sauna. <br/>We will gather for delicious long-table dinners, enjoy sound healing with Jenny and a more upbeat evening with a signature RAVE playlist. <br/><br/>Your ticket also includes a rich goodie bag with snacks from True and Cosmic dealer, aromatherapy from love and stones, a magic of I journal and more.<br/><br/>Check-in: Thursday between 17:00–19:00.<br/>Check-out: Sunday between 12:00–13:00.<br/><br/>Further information will be send out via email when signing up.<br/></p>"

With her Danish roots and Scandinavian flair, Trine brings a little Nordic magic to the retreat. Her cooking is inspired by the vibrant, seasonal produce of Denmark and Sweden, where fresh ingredients are celebrated in every meal, from foraged herbs and mushrooms to farm-fresh as well as tangy pickled vegetables. Each dish is a perfect match for the yoga vibes of the weekend — light, energizing, and oh-so-satisfying</p>",
