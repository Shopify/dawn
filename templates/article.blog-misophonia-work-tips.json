There are many misunderstandings about disorders like misophonia (and others, like autism). People might ask questions like “is misophonia a mental illness?” so be prepared to debunk some myths.<\/p><p>It is important that you communicate that misophonia is a recognized disorder that reduces your tolerance to certain sounds, often triggering intense emotional or physiological responses. If you’re going to define misophonia, you can also mention that it is often linked to high intelligence. Something in your favor! Next, explain your misophonia triggers. This could range from the sound of marker on a whiteboard, to chewing noises at lunch. Don’t hold back: be up-front about what sets you off. Also think about your ideal misophonia “treatment”: feel free to come up with suggestions yourself, including some of the approaches below.<\/p>"
