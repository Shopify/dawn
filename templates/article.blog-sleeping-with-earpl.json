This increases the risk of the earplugs becoming stuck in your ear canals, which is not only painful but potentially dangerous if you don’t remove them properly. <\/p><p>If they become lodged, you can seriously harm the delicate interior of your ear by trying to take them out on your own.

It is a treatment that concentrates on the here and now, rather than searching for a root cause in the past in the way that many other therapies do.<\/p><p><em><strong>Exposure therapy<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>Exposure therapy, or systematic desensitization, is another type of psychotherapy that is regularly utilized when treating people with phonophobia.<\/p><p>It works by using guided and repeated exposure to the phobia in question in order to desensitize the patient.
