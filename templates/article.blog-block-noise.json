Get soundproofing<\/strong> <\/p><p>We’ve all wondered how to block out noise when trying to sleep. It can be tricky because sound can find its way through the smallest of gaps.  <\/p><p>And because fully soundproofing a room can be costly and take a lot of time, there are some quick fixes you can do to reduce the external sound coming in: <\/p><ul><li><strong>Seal all gaps and cracks<\/strong> <\/li><\/ul><p>Check window frames, door frames, floorboards, and skirting boards and seal them using an appropriate acoustic sealant, if possible. You can also try rolling up a towel or other suitable material and placing it at the bottom of your bedroom door.  <\/p><ul><li><strong>Hang heavy curtains or drapes<\/strong> <\/li><\/ul><p>Heavy material hung on the windows can be ideal for soaking up unwanted sound. You could even try hanging wall drapes over the offending wall. Using material as a barrier can be hugely effective to block sound while sleeping.  <\/p><ul><li><strong>Buy a <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.idealhome.co.uk\/news\/new-blackout-soundproof-blinds-232808\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>blackout blind for noise reduction<\/strong><\/span><\/a> <\/li><\/ul><p>They exist! And they’re revolutionizing sleep for light sleepers out there.  <\/p><p>What’s more, not only do they block out noise when you’re sleeping, but they also block out light from street lamps or the early morning sun – win-win! <\/p><ul><li><strong>Create a barrier <\/strong> <\/li><\/ul><p>Put something solid between you and the noise, like a bookshelf unit, your wardrobe, cupboards – anything that will work as a barrier to dull the noise of your partying neighbor or loud housemate.  <\/p>",

Communication is key<\/strong> <\/p><p> People live their lives differently.  <\/p><p>Some are early risers, some are night owls, some work night shifts, and some love to party. <\/p><p>Whatever the situation, you may find that having a constructive conversation with the people involved works wonders. Maybe even a little negotiation might be the key.  <\/p><p>Let them know that their noise is affecting your sleep and impacts well-being. <\/p><p>Always try to keep calm and be reasonable. The solution may be simpler than you think and surprise you both. <\/p><p>If your neighbor is a fan of loud music, resist the temptation to blast it back at them at an ungodly hour. It may give you the brief relief of satisfaction in the moment, but in the long run it’s better for your brain (and the situation) to keep it civil.  <\/p><p><strong>4. Report it<\/strong> <\/p><p>It may sound dramatic, but if the polite conversations aren’t working, contacting your local authority may be the next step to take.  <\/p><p>Looking up your local laws on sound can help you get clued up to ensure you have precedent for your complaint. You can find out what time builders are allowed to start using power tools, what time fireworks can go on till, or how late music can be played online. <\/p><p>If you’re in rented accommodation, it may also be worth checking if the soundproofing in your building meets building regulations. <\/p>",
