I’ll have to focus on what the speaker is saying so I don’t miss any important information.” Instead of leaving the room, you might lean forward and listen to what’s being said more intently.

You can also get even more control over the volume around you with Loop Mutes, which you can add to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loopearplugs.com\/products\/experience\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Experience earplugs<\/span><\/a> for an extra 5 decibels of sound protection.<\/p><p>That means you can wear them in meetings or in the break room to take the edge off those annoying noises while allowing you to stay focused on what’s being said – so you’ll never have to leave the room and miss something important again.<\/p><p>It’s not recommend to wear earplugs constantly, as that could make your reaction to the triggering sounds worse in the long run. If you completely avoid your trigger sounds, then you can become even more susceptible to them. Instead, it’s best to use earplugs as a tool to take the edge off as you get more used to the triggering sounds. <\/p>",

That’s why misophonia is so often accompanied by sweaty palms and a racing heart.<\/p><p>Meditation, then, can help you to calm down in the face of these perceived threats. The practice of mindfulness can also help to alleviate the stress response to triggering sounds, by helping one to cultivate an awareness of the thoughts and feelings you experience upon hearing a triggering sound.<\/p><p>Breathing exercises can also help you to control your reactions to difficult noises.
