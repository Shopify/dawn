All dates are subject to change. Sponsor's clock is the official timekeeping device for all Sweepstakes. The entry must fulfill all sweepstakes requirements, as specified, to be eligible to win a prize. Entries that are not complete or do not adhere to the rules or specifications may be disqualified at the sole discretion of Sponsor. Unless otherwise indicated in the Sweepstakes Description Page (which shall control for purposes of number of entries allowed), you may enter only once and any attempt to enter more times than indicated by using multiple email addresses, identities or devices in an attempt to circumvent the rules is void and will result in disqualification.<br/><br/>PRIZE: Actual/appraised value may differ at time of prize award. The difference in value of a prize as stated in the Sweepstakes Description Page and the value at time of prize notification, if any, will not be awarded. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize of equal or greater value. The specifics of the prize shall be solely determined by the Sponsor. If any element of prize is forfeited, no alternate prize or compensation will be awarded. Prize is non-transferable and does not include travel unless otherwise stated in Sweepstakes Description Page. Any and all prize related expenses, including without limitation any and all federal, state, and/or local taxes shall be the sole responsibility of the winner.

By submitting content as an entry in a Sweepstakes, you <strong>(if a minor, your parent or legal guardian)</strong> understand that Sponsor or anyone acting on behalf of Sponsor, or its respective licensees, successors and assigns will have the right, where permitted by law, without any further notice, review or consent to print, publish, broadcast, distribute, and use, worldwide in any media now known or hereafter in perpetuity and throughout the world, your entry, including, without limitation, the entry and winner's name, portrait, picture, voice, likeness, image or statements about the Sweepstakes, and biographical information as news, publicity or information and for trade, advertising, public relations and promotional purposes without any compensation.<br/><br/>ODDS OF WINNING; WINNER NOTIFICATION: Sweepstakes winners will be selected by random draw. Actual odds of winning a particular sweepstakes depend on the number of eligible entries received. Potential Winners (subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the Sweepstakes rules) may be announced publicly by Sponsor on The Normal Brand social media. Sponsor will notify each winner by a means set out on the Sweepstakes Description Page of a Sweepstakes with five (5) business days after the time and date listed on the Sweepstakes Description Page (the “Winner Notification”). A winner must respond to the Winner Notification within 48 hours of receipt of the Winner Notification and, in order to be eligible to accept a prize, must include in such response all required information which may include: (i) winner’s full legal name, (ii) current residential mailing address, (iii) phone number, and (iv) date of birth. If a winner fails to respond to the Winner Notification in the time and in the manner required, or if a Winner Notification is returned as undeliverable, such Winner will be disqualified and will be deemed to have forfeited his/her prize without compensation of any kind. Sponsor shall have no liability for a winner's failure to receive notices due to winners' spam, junk e-mail or other security settings, winners’ failure to follow/like the The Normal Brand social media page, or for winners' provision of incorrect or otherwise non-functioning contact information. It is the sole responsibility of an entrant to notify Sponsor of any changes in his/her name and/or address (or other contact information). Each winning entrant <strong>(if a minor, his/her parent or legal guardian) </strong>must sign and return any documents, if requested, within the time period stipulated by the Sponsor. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and prize forfeiture without compensation of any kind. Any notification returned as undeliverable may result in disqualification and the prize may be awarded to another entrant. In the event a winning entry is discovered to be invalid for any other reason whatsoever, the prize may be forfeited and awarded to an alternate winner. For any legally required prize winner list, or for an additional copy of these Official Rules, email Sponsor at <strong>customercare@thenormalbrand.com</strong> by the deadline set forth on the Sweepstakes Description Page.
